    "notes": "Ground-based ad system optimized for use against armored helicopters and low flying fixed-wing aircraft. Missile employs smokeless propellant for minimal signature. Flight time (5-8 sec) and guidance make it essentially immune to countermeasures. Because of the high velocity, the system exceeds the hit probability of competing systems against high-speed aircraft on receding flight paths.\nThe Startstreak's lower cost and capabilities as a multi-role missile system offers varied uses. Two considerations are the semi-automatic command line-of-sight (SACLOS) guidance and contact fuses which make it less effective against agile fixed-wing aircraft from some aspects. Thus a more practical course would be to replace 33-50% of the MANPADS. With the lower cost of STARSTREAK and its multi-role capability, it could replace a portion of the expensive single-role MANPADS with Starstreaks, for instance, an 18-manpads battery could be reduced 35%.",
